Brainrot your youtube videos.

Python 3.11.10

1) create virtual environment
2) install dependencies
3) create .env file and add OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
4) run brainrot_types/create_brainrot.py:
    * run 'export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/the/project/root' in case python can't see modules
5) It takes approximately 2 minutes to generate a video, you can see the generated video in results/hash_printed_inconsole

Check literally the first video I have generated when project was done (might be low quality because i store it at some free, but noname, video hosting platform)
